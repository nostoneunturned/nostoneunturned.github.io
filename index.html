									No Stone Unturned is a Tabletop RPG about exploring a world long after a calamity. This site contains the full rules, which are broken into 4 main parts. Grab the links below or on the sidebar. This is a living document which will be updated with changes to the rules until the final version is published. Thanks for reading!
									<br>
									<br>
									The .pdf can be purchased on itch.io. Additionally, we will be crowdfunding the printing of a zine containing the full rules as a part of Zine Quest in February 2020.
									<br>
									<br>
									Feel free to remix these rules and make whole new games out of them. All I ask is that you let me know about your project so I can check it out and that you reference No Stone Unturned somewhere in the document as an inspiration.
									<br>
									If you are using the "Details" system, that is based on the Indie Hack, so refer to <a href="http://www.scablandspress.com/srd/">their SRD</a> for attribution requirements.
