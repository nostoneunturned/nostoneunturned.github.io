									No Stone Unturned is a complete tabletop roleplaying game for 2-6 players. It's designed to play as a one-shot or short campaign, with sessions lasting from 2-4 hours each. Players will create characters and locations and take turns as the Arbiters of the world, meaning there is no set Game Master. 
									<br>
									<br>
You will create a story that features characters living in a world unrecognizable to our own. Their society is starting to pick up the pieces after yet another apocalypse. Natural catastrophes, manmade disasters, and external influences have caused collapse after collapse, but humanity has somehow hung on. Remainders of each of these civilizations and artifacts of their downfalls lurk hidden throughout the world.
									<br>
									<br>
Enough time has passed that many settlements have stabilized and are now looking to expand and explore what is around them. The characters that you will play live in one of these settlements and are tasked with exploring the world around them and acquiring what resources and knowledge that can be found. While that may sound like a noble cause, other societies, recovering wildlife, unstable ecosystems, and volatile remnants from disasters past are scattered all throughout the land. If these adventurers aren't careful, their actions will endanger their neighbors as well as their own homesâ€¦

This site contains the full rules, which are broken into 4 main parts. Grab the links below or on the sidebar. This is a living document which will be updated with changes to the rules until the final version is published. Thanks for reading!

									The .pdf can be purchased on itch.io. Additionally, we will be crowdfunding the printing of a zine containing the full rules as a part of Zine Quest in February 2020.
