#### Ludography
_No Stone Unturned_ is heavily inspired by games from these authors:

John Harper’s _[Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel)_ directly inspired the down-time mechanics. This game is Forged in the Dark.

Slade Stolar’s _[The Indie Hack](http://www.scablandspress.com/srd/)_ features the details-based dice resolution present in this game, thus this game runs on The Indie Hack Engine.

Meguey Baker and D.Vincent Baker’s _[Apocalypse World](http://apocalypse-world.com/)_ laid a framework and design philosophy for many games, including this one. This game is Powered by the Apocalypse.

Fraser Simons’s _[The Veil](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/199467/The-Veil-Cyberpunk-Roleplaying-Powered-by-the-Apocalypse)_ explored using how a character feels as a basis for how they perform actions, and this game shows my take on that.

Avery Alder’s _[The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year)_ is a game about the wants and needs of a community in struggle, and inspired many of the world building tools here.
