#### Ludography
_No Stone Unturned_ is heavily inspired by games from these authors:

John Harper’s _Blades in the Dark_ directly inspired the down-time mechanics.This game is Forged in the Dark.

Slade Stolar’s _The Indie Hack_ features the details-based dice resolution present in this game, thus this game runs on The Indie Hack Engine.

Meguey Baker and D.Vincent Baker’s _Apocalypse World_ laid a framework and design philosophy for many games, including this one.This game is Powered by the Apocalypse.

Fraser Simons’s _The Veil_ explored using how a character feels as a basis for how they perform actions, and this game shows my take on that.

Avery Alder’s _The Quiet Year_ is a game about the wants and needs of a community in struggle, and inspired many of the world building tools here.
