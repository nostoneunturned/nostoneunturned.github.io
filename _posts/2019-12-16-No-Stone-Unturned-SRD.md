## Part 1: Introduction and Worldbuilding



### Introduction



After the world inevitably fell, people built a new one from its ashes. Time passed, and eventually this new world crumbled and was rebuilt once more. Some say this cycle is just the natural order of things. The people left after a collapse never agree on everything that went wrong. They lead their descendants to correct some of the errors that lead to collapse while repeating some of the others.

You are about to create a story that features characters living in a world unrecognizable to our own. Their society is starting to pick up the pieces after one of these cyclical crises. Natural catastrophes, manmade disasters, and maybe even external influences have caused collapse after collapse, but humanity has somehow hung on. Remainders of each of these civilizations and artifacts of their downfalls lurk hidden throughout the world.

Enough time has passed that many settlements have stabilized and are now looking to expand and explore what is around them. The characters that you will play live in one of these settlements and are tasked with exploring the world around the settlement and acquiring what resources and knowledge that can be found. While that may sound like a noble cause, the world around them is populated by other societies, recovering wildlife, unstable ecosystems, and volatile remnants from disasters past. If these adventurers aren't careful, their actions will endanger their neighbors as well as their own homes…



_No Stone Unturned_ is a tabletop roleplaying game for 2-5 people. Each of you will play a character who will be going on adventures in the world. You will also be taking turns acting as Arbiters, describing the world and how it reacts to the adventurer’s actions.

The game is best played as a short campaign, with several game sessions lasting 2-4 hours. In the first session, you will be guided through the world building and character creation steps outlined in the following pages. After that, you’ll set out on your first adventure.

In further sessions, you will continue to explore the world that you have built until it feels right to stop. Between adventures, you’ll see the characters during downtime as they rest and recuperate. You will also be seeing how your incursions change the world over time, and how those changes are often not for the better.

This game can also be played as a one-shot. If you plan to do this, I’d recommend moving through the world building and character creation steps as quickly as you can – it can be very easy to get so lost in building a world that you suddenly realize that you’re almost out of time. The steps provided on the following pages should guide you to building a cool world that you’re excited to play in, even if they are approached with a brisk pace.



### Safety Tools



In this game, you will be collaborating on a story with improvisational, off-the-cuff roleplaying and creativity. The direction of the story is unpredictable, and so it's important to make sure that everyone has the tools to redirect the conversation if they become uncomfortable in a way that they don't wish to be. Whether the discomfort comes from venturing into a certain topic or the way other players are behaving, players should feel comfortable and safe. After all, this is a game and everyone should be having a good time.

Often when we find ourselves in a situation where we're uncomfortable, it can be difficult to speak up for any number of reasons. There are several methods that are commonly used to make it easier to ensure a safer environment for play Discuss with your group and decide what makes the most sense to put in place.

_The X-Card:_ Originally designed by John Stavropolous, the X-Card is an index card with an X drawn on it that any player can at any time point to to walk back whatever is currently be discussed, no questions asked. A complete description can be found at http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg

_Lines and Veils:_ Before the game starts, pull out two index cards and ask everyone to write down what their lines and veils are. Lines are topics that shouldn’t be brought up under any circumstance, whereas veils are topics that are fine to be in the story but should not be discussed in detail or zoomed in on.

_Knocks:_ This is similar to the X-card, but without the card. Anybody can knock on the table, and everyone should either walk back what is being discussed or fast forward until it’s over.



### Worldbuilding



Building a world collaboratively

Once you have discussed safety at the table, it’s time to start building the world that you will be playing in. The next couple of pages will walk you through several steps for this. 

#### 1. Discuss Broadly

Start with a brief discussion on what this post-post apocalypse setting should look like. You should try to agree on a tone for your game, as well as how you will be framing scenes. Should it be more serious and weird like the world of Numenera? Or should it be zany like what is seen in Adventure Time, with scenes and logic that you would only find in a cartoon? Is it ruinous and filled with living or robotic remnants of what came before, like Horizon: Zero Dawn? Don't get too specific here, but try to think of some touch stones and get everybody on the same page.

#### 2. Ban Story Elements

After a few minutes of discussion, you each get to ban something from the setting. Choose something you don't think would be interesting in this story and write it on a notecard within view of everybody. This is the first opportunity to codify the results of the tonal discussion, as this ban list must be followed.

Do you want there to be no magic? No fantasy races? No dungeons or no dragons?

Note that this is not for banning things that make you uncomfortable in some way - this is meant to be a friendly game and you should tell your group to steer clear of topics that you're not comfortable engaging in with them. See page 3 for more information about Safety Protocols.

This phase is more for restricting the lens of what the rest of the game can include from a storytelling perspective. It is perfectly valid to pass up this chance.



#### 3. Drawing the Settlement

Next, you will collaboratively create the settlement that your characters live in and are adventuring into the world to find ways to improve. 

Place a notecard in the center of the table. Choose a person to go first, and then take turns. On your turn, you will make a statement about the settlement, and draw something to represent that on the index card. Don't worry if you can't draw, neither can I. The player to your left will then make another statement, either introducing a new fact or further specifying a previous one. Also draw this on the index card. Continue around the table like this until either there is no more room on the index card, or two people have decided to pass on their turn. If you pass in one round you can always add a new idea the next round.

After a few turns of this, your group will start to get a better picture of how the world works. Keep building on each others’ ideas and a shared understanding of where your characters live will come from it.

Don’t put too much into just one statement. "The paved roads form a grid" works better than "The settlement is a city, with buildings on every block surrounded by paved roads in a grid shape". Focus on only one aspect of life at a time and let the other players branch off from there.

#### 4. Define adventure scope and conditions

Define the scope of the adventures and how far away the other locations in the world are from your settlement. Think about what the conditions of adventure are, and whether your characters are well equipped or struggling to get by. This will help color what the locations each player creates in the next step should look like as well as what your characters will have access to on their adventures.



Write down what you establish here so that everyone can access it later. The following questions help guide you in defining your scope, but are not a complete list.

* How much time passes between adventures?

* How long does it take to travel around the world?

* Is the surrounding area dangerous or easy to traverse?

* Do people generally need to eat and sleep? If so, how often? What do they eat?

* What can you assume that your characters will be carrying? Swords? Guns? Nothing?

* What's the general level of technology available to the settlement?

* How do people get around in this world? Can they fly? Use phones? Teleport?

* What’s the day/night schedule like? How often do the seasons change?

* Can you maintain contact with your home settlement while adventuring?

#### 5. Create scarcities and abundances

Each player then names a resource that is important to your community. If you’re playing with less than 5 people, collectively establish a couple more resources until you have 5 total. Then, decide together which one of these resources is in abundance and mark the rest as scarcities. One of the players' main tasks will be to secure these resources from locations around them. Note these down on a notecard within view of everybody.

Understand resources broadly here. At its simplest, this can mean food or water, but anything that a society needs and uses can be put forth here. Entertainment, camraderie, sunlight, agricultural variety, you name it. The point of this exercise is to define what’s important as well as what’s lacking, so if you say something like “competitive spirit” or “comfortable beds and couches” then those become a focus of the daily lives of your characters.

#### 6. Author locations

Now that you have an idea of the settlement, it’s time to build out the surrounding area that your characters will be adventuring in. This is done by creating a map on the table using index cards. You will each privately be authoring two locations that will be out in the world somewhere.

Each player takes two index cards and creates two locations. These can be anything - a cave system with mysterious artifacts inside, a populated city, a haunted mansion, whatever you might want to see in play. The only rule here is that you can't contradict facts that were established in the settlement building phase or use story elements that were banned. While doing this, you can chat and futher clarify the world, but don’t show anyone your card. 

Draw what is here and write a short description of the place.

Draw an 8-piece pie chart in the corner. This will be the Collateral Clock at this location. Write a few words underneath it describing what at this location can be harmed if the characters interfere here. Examples could include animals or people that live here, the social structures of the population that are here already, a food or water source for local or regional inhabitants, etc.

Write, briefly, what type of danger might lurk there - monsters, nature, people who are resistant to your goals, etc.

Write what type of treasure or knowledge might be found there. Examples could be ancient troves of knowledge, artifacts from a civilization past, a population to be your allies, something to address one of the shortages at home, or something that helps solve a mystery that came up at the settlement. Anything that the characters may want to collect or absorb works here.



#### 7. Arrange locations in a map

Mix up the created locations and place them face down in some arrangement on the table. This will be your map and represent where places are with respect to each other. If you want to have to pass through locations to get to others often, create a pattern to represent that and define the paths that you will need to take to get from card to card. You can also create a tightly packed grid so that it’s easy to get to any location card. Feel free to leave blank spots as well.

Depending on the scope that your group defined the pattern you choose may make a big difference. If each card is defined to be a one day journey away from the next, then it's less important because the adventurers can go back and forth from the locations to home.  However, if it takes weeks to travel from place to place, adventuring far from home will be more stressful and taxing, as you will return home to allow your characters to relax and recover much less often.

#### 8. Assign Danger and Reward Levels

Now that you have a map of the surrounding area, you will roll dice for each card to see how dangerous and how rewarding the locations will be for adventurers.

Roll 2 4-sided dice for each notecard. The first d4 will dictate how potent the listed danger is to the adventurers, and the second d4 will dictate how useful the listed reward will be to the party if it is found. Write these values on the back blank side of each card (e.g. D2 R4). See the "Danger and Reward Levels" section for a detailed explanation of what these values mean.

#### 9. Character Creation

Your world is now built. You should now have a good idea of where your characters live and what their lives are like. You also now have a map of locations that they will explore and investigate. The next pages walk you through creating the characters that you will play for the rest of the game.



### Creating your characters

Your characters are made up of several different elements. Some of these elements will be decided now, and others will be discovered through play. Take a character sheet and fill out the fields as described below.

#### 1. Choose a name

Come up with a name for your character. You can either do this now, or wait until the end.

#### 2. Define your pronouns and look

Note your characters pronouns and describe what they look like. Are they human? What kind of clothes do they wear?

#### 3. Pick three moods

Choose 3 moods your character is most often experiencing while they adventure. Examples can include Feckless, Angry, Joyous, Jealous, Ambivalent, or Curious, but really any moods that you're interested in roleplaying will do.

Assign one mood to a d8, one to a d6, and one to a d4 line on your character sheet. When you make an Action Roll while playing the game, you will be using the die granted to you by the mood your character is acting from. 

A bigger die roll doesn't always mean better. If your actions have a chance to harm you, rolling a bigger Mood die will mean you are more likely to get hurt. However, if your action is more likely to damage the environment, a bigger Mood die means you are more likely to succeed and avoid those complications.

Thus, choose your d8 Mood as the one your character acts from when they’re taking care not to damage the world around them, and the d4 when they’re protecting themselves. The d6 will be somewhere in between. The specific dice mechanics are explained in a later section.

These three moods are not every possible mood that your character can experience. There are three slots left open at character creation. During play, you can assign a new mood if the currently listed ones with don't fit how your character is feeling.

#### 4. Assign your aspects

Assign Body, Mind, and Heart to the d4, d6, and d8 based on how your character performs certain tasks. Body is used for feats of athleticism and might. Mind lends you the ability to think quickly and call on a breadth of knowledge. Heart represents your ability to connect with others and push through difficult situations.

As mentioned in the Moods section, bigger doesn't always mean better. The aspect dice are the opposite: a bigger die typically means you're better at protecting yourself using that aspect, but potentially at the expense of your surroundings.

#### 5. Invent three sentiments

Next is to choose three things that are important to your character. These could be prized possessions, relationships, ideals, beliefs, or anything else that your character holds dear. Try not to have more than one of each of these sentimental categories, e.g. one possession, one belief, and one relationship. If you want to forge a relationship with another character as one of your sentiments, it’s okay to leave a line here blank until everyone has introduced themselves.

Mechanically, these sentiments will provide the ability to modify your dice rolls and results at the risk of them being lost to you or corrupted in some way by the world.

#### 6. Write three skills

Describe broadly 3 actions that your character is good at doing. Conversation, swordplay, climbing, parkour. Mark them down in the skills section as +/-1 skills. These can be leveled up later and new skills can be added, as described in the skills section.

#### 7. Consider the rumors

As a player, you authored 2 locations that now exist in the world. Your character has heard something about each of them. Consider how they have come across these rumors and what they’ve heard. They don’t know where exactly these locations are, but they would certainly recognize them upon arrival.

#### 8. Introduce yourself

Once everyone has finished making a character, go around the table and introduce yourselves. Describe how your character looks, what they’re good at, and what they care about.



### Danger Levels

The Danger Level gives a guideline for how perilous it should feel to be in an area. Typically, in an area with a higher danger level, you should be assigning Harm Details when players lose rolls more often. Below is a detailed description of how the different danger levels change the tone of a location.

D1.	You can avoid the worst of the danger by being careful. Wildlife is reserved and defensive, and people who live here tend to give you the benefit of the doubt.

D2.	There are dangerous things here, but you’ll know about it before it happens. Most wildlife only attack when provoked, and the people who live here are generally welcoming, if cautious.

D3.	The danger here is meaningful. Wildlife is wary and has the means to hurt you if they choose to strike. People aren't the most welcoming, and if you manage to make peaceful contact, you should not cross them.

D4.	Most things in the area are hostile to you. The consequences for improperly engaging are great. Wildlife won't wait for a reason to strike, and you must work hard to prove that you are trustworthy to any people.



### Reward Levels

The Reward Level of an area indicates how useful treasures and knowledge gained in an area will be. The below descriptions indicate how easy and useful a location’s reward will be if it’s fully acquired.

R1.	The reward here is scattered, encoded, broken, or otherwise difficult to access. Mechanically, it will take a long term project to utilize the reward properly. At best, this reward combined with completing a long term project to unlock it will move a scarcity to neutral (not abundance).

R2.	A long-term project during downtime can move a resource from a scarcity to neutral. A second project would be required to then move it to abundance. For example, if the reward is an electric generator, you might need to first complete a project to see how the generator works before you can start a project to fuel it and turn it on.

R3.	This can completely move a scarcity to neutral. A long term project can yield more of its potential and lead it to abundance. If the reward doesn’t address a scarcity, this can create a new abundance.

R4.	This can move a scarcity to abundance if fully recovered and taken back to the settlement. The thing that can be found here is very useful and useable.



## Part 2: Gameplay

### Game Overview

How to Play This Game

A session of No Stone Unturned is played out as a series of adventures. As a group, decide which card on the map to head to from their current location. Flip that card to reveal the location at hand. The author of the card will then paint the picture of what this location looks like and what is at stake. Use the Reward and Danger Levels as guides for the intensity of the description. More details on what those should correspond to are on the next page. Describe the reward that can be found here.

Each player then narrates a few sentences about the journey to that location as well as how their character feels about the task ahead of them. The characters then will split into two groups. Play out a brief scene on how you split up and who is with who.

The players whose characters are not on screen will act as the Arbiters for those that are. Arbiters function in the same way as GMs in more traditional roleplaying games - describing scenes, acting as NPCs, and introducing conflict to the characters' lives. The group that the author of the card is a part of will typically be the Arbiters first, so that they can set the scene a little better. 

Sometimes, an action that a character undertakes will be uncertain and require a dice roll to resolve. This will be resolved using an Action Roll, which will allow certain players to add Details to the scene.

After a few action rolls, it's a good idea to switch to the other group as the tension in this scene rises. A cliffhanger or something that can affect both parties at once is a good place to change focus. Every time you switch focus or break up the party, all of the players not “on screen” will act as Arbiters together. 

Eventually, it will make sense for this adventure to come to a close. Your characters will meet up for one reason or another and likely leave the area that they are staying in. Perhaps you have found some treasure or knowledge, and maybe you are fleeing for your lives.

When that happens, there are decisions to make both in and out of character. First, if you haven’t taken a break from playing in a while, now is a good time to do so. You’ll also need to decide if this is the end of your current session.

In character, you will decide whether to head back to your home settlement, or make camp somewhere else that is safe. Whatever choice you make, the game will shift into Downtime.

The Downtime phase is described in greater detail later in the book, but it follows the same process every time. First, you roll for complications due to your actions at the location your characters just left and have a conversation about what immediately changes in your wake.

Next, each of your characters will have a chance to take one Downtime Action to recover from wounds, research how best to use the treasures they have taken, or try to patch up the problems that they caused while adventuring.

If one action isn’t enough, you can collectively decide to spend more time at rest. However, every time you take another round of Downtime actions, you will roll for complications at one of the areas that you’ve visited. The world keeps moving even when you’re not.

If you continue playing after downtime, adventure to a new location. Either flip a new card that you have access to, or return to an old one that you weren’t quite finished with. 



### Details

####  “Adding Details” in play

When players attempt things that are uncertain, they will make an action roll. The results of this will allow either the player or the Arbiters to add Details to the fiction. Details are just labels to succinctly explain a change in the fiction. For instance, if you were in a fight and your opponent pulled out a knife, you could end up with a detail, Stabbed.

_Hard details_ describe a fundamental change to some property of a person, place, or thing (e.g., dealing damage, changing an object, annoying someone). They are added explicitly as a result of an Action Roll. During the game,  write down all hard details added to a character, weapon, enemy, etc. For example, if you are rolling to convince the baseball coach to let you pinch hit, and you win the roll, you can add Persuaded as a hard detail to the coach.

_Soft details_ can be added more freely and make only temporary or superficial changes to the world (e.g., moving around, calling out to an ally, asking a character a question). These are often added implicitly via moment-to-moment roleplaying (without saying you’re adding details to the scene). When you’re describing a scene or what your character is doing, you’re adding soft details. Thus, soft details need not be written down. If granted a hard detail, you can always choose to add a soft detail instead.

A _scene detail_ is a detail that changes the scenery or your tactics, i.e., things that are part of the scene, but not a property of a character or item. For example, if you are rolling to blast open a door and the result of your Action Roll grants you one scene detail, you can simply add Blasted Open to the door and then walk right through it. If granted a hard detail, you can choose to add a scene detail instead. The Arbiters will maintain a list of scene details.



####  Positive vs. Negative Details

Details are typically negative or positive. Negative details are often harm details, which indicate damage to a character or item. Positive details are beneficial properties (e.g., Shiny and Sharp for a well-maintained sword).

Adding details drives the fiction forward from moments of uncertainty. If you’re stuck, just think back to the goal the character was trying to achieve and go from there. Don’t be afraid to push it and make dramatic changes to the scene! The important thing with the details you add is that they should make the story and world more exciting to you and to the other players at the table.

Action Roll Results

The result of an action roll determines how many hard details and scene details can be added after a roll and who gets to add them. When a player makes an action roll, they will be rolling two dice. They will then subtract the lower die from the higher die and compare the difference to the table below. The specifics of determining the winning side are discussed in the detailed steps for resolving Action Rolls. 



### Harm Details

Harm details track the physical and mental toll that adventure takes on an explorer's body. Any details added by the Arbiters that make it difficult to continue adventuring in the same way should be counted here. Each player character has the capacity for 4 harm details before they get the Overcome detail. 

Harm details cover more than just physical harm. Arbiters can assign harm details in any situation. A harm detail can be something physical like Sprained Ankle or Concussed, emotional like Embarrassed or Distraught, or even social like Ignored or Cast Out.

Harm details can be addressed by using the Recover action during Downtime. When a harm detail is addressed in this way, it is turned into a scar, which is a detail that will remain on your character sheet. Scars do not count as harm details and thus don’t contribute to a characting being overcome.



### Overcome

When a player records their 4th Harm Detail, they get the _Overcome_ detail. Circle this on your character sheet.

Overcome characters must be rescued and taken to a safe place as soon as possible. The player must use the Recover downtime move to clear at least one of the details before they can act again.

Decide on a case by case basis what this means for your table. Depending on the type of harm they received, the character may need to retire from adventuring or even perish. Be honest with the fiction here, and allow yourself to let go of the character if the situation calls for it.



### Recording Details

When hard details are assigned to your character, record them in the details section on your character sheet. If the Arbiters say that the detail counts as a harm detail, record it on one of the 4 lines designated for Harm Details.

Otherwise, your character can have any number of positive and negative details. Make sure to consider what details you have while roleplaying and acting within the world, as they should inform how you interact with your surroundings.

Also remember to consider all of your details when resolving Action Rolls, as certain details can offer advantage or disadvantage to your Aspect Dice, as described on the following pages.



### Applying Details

Don’t be afraid to think bigger than the action being tested when applying Details. A seemingly small action can have ripples throughout the land. Perhaps a player loses a roll to convince somebody in a new town that they mean no harm. You can apply Details in several ways. Here are two examples.

You could apply the scene detail Uncooperative Population to inform the player that this conversation will leak out and there will be subsets of this population that will no longer cooperate with the adventurers and may even be outright hostile to them.

You could also apply the hard detail Wanted to them - you hear shouts outside the building where you are having this conversation. A protest has formed to kick out the intruders. What do you do?

### Recording Scene Details

Make sure to keep track of the scene details added to a location (such as Uncooperative Population from the example above). This will help you maintain a record of what the adventurers have done to a location, which will aid in determining other scene details and also when Rolling for Complications in the future. Additionally, Scene Details should almost always be accompanied by a tick on the Collateral Clock. This is discussed in detail later.

### Adding Details to NPCs or creatures

If a character gets in a fight or similar situation where an NPC or creature is standing in their way, it will often only take one or two Details for the player to handle the situation.

For example, if you’re trying to convince a person to let you through the door and into a more restricted area, you can add Bribed as a hard detail to them after rolling to see if they’ll accept your bribe.

Maybe you’re in a fist fight with somebody after a conversation went the wrong way. You can add Knocked Out after winning a roll to punch them square in the jaw.

However, the Arbiters can decide to declare that a stronger person or monster has a threshold before they are Overcome like the player characters. This would be some number of harm details that the NPC would need to take before they are completely taken out of the scene. This number should be between 2 and 4.



## Action Rolls

### When to call for an Action Roll

The Action Roll mechanic is in place to determine the results when an action taken by the player character has an uncertain outcome. When a player character tries to do something in one of the below categories, or another situation where the outcome being unclear is interesting, the Action Roll mechanics should be followed.

* Doing that which a person doesn’t normally do, like climb a difficult surface, pick a lock, etc

* Doing something dangerous, like attack a person/creature or jump across a chasm

* Looking for a thing or some information that may be difficult to locate, like a secret entrance or the password to enter

* Calling upon some memory or knowledge that the character might know, but hasn’t yet shown or used

* Doing something that could cause harm to the world around them

* Persuading or convincing another person in the world to do something that they don’t immediately want to do, especially if it’s against their perceived interest

* Avoiding or reacting to some consequence or danger that is imminent

* Observing or otherwise interacting with the world to glean information or notice something that’s happening that isn’t immediately obvious. This should only trigger an action roll if it will be interesting for the character to not catch on



### When not to call for an action roll

Don’t call for an action roll for every little thing that the characters try to do. If the stakes are low or the character is known to be good at the action they are attempting, let them succeed.

Action rolls should come into play when the outcome is not obvious, or when the potential for failure and consequence is more interesting than success.

Don’t call for an action roll in order any time the characters try to get any information from the world. Most questions and requests to observe the world should be freely answered. Only use the roll when interesting consequences  are a possibility.

### “Passing and Failing”

Losing an Action roll doesn’t necessarily mean that your character failed in what they were trying to do. Often, the hard and scene details applied by the Arbiters will heavily complicate the action, but it should never lead you to a dead end. The question to answer after any Details are applied should always be, “What do you do?”



## Action Roll Steps

The next page outlines the steps to follow when the Arbiters call for an action roll, with the following pages explaining each step in more detail. 

It seems like there are a lot of steps to go through here, but that’s because it is broken down into as small of pieces as possible to make it easier to reference exactly what the rules have you do. I would recommend following along in the book the first couple of times you do this to get a feel for what each of the steps is designed to add to the story. It will slow things down at first, but it will be a breeze once your table is comfortable with the procedure.



Anything in the outline not in italics happens every time you roll the dice. The italicized steps are optional.

#### Before Rolling:

- * Player states their desired outcome

- * Arbiters choose aspect and state what's most at risk 

- * Choose Mood and increment Mood Level

- * Check details for Aspect Advantage or Disadvantage

- Choose or create Relevant Skill*

- Risk Sentiment for Mood Advantage*

#### Roll the dice!

- Roll your Aspect Die and Mood Die

#### After Rolling:

- Get help. They roll a Mood and raise its level.*

- * Determine the Winning Side and apply Details
 
- * Check for Mood Effects





#### Player states their desired outcome

State what your character is attempting to accomplish. This should be the logical follow through of the action that you were roleplaying when the Arbiters called for an action roll. Now is the time to flesh out what you want to have happen with this course of action. This gets everyone at the table on the same page with what's at stake and what success would look like.


#### Arbiters choose Aspect and state what's most at risk 

First, the Arbiters decide whether this action roll uses Body, Mind, or Heart. Body is used for feats of athleticism and might. Mind lends you the ability to think quickly and call on a breadth of knowledge. Heart represents your ability to connect with others and push through difficult situations. You will use the die associated with this Aspect when they roll.

The Arbiters then decide whether the consequences of this action are more likely to affect the Character or the World around them. The Arbiters should elaborate to the table why that is the case. Describe what the risk is and gesture at what failure might look like.

This decision will decide which die will count for which side when determining the result:

- If the Character is at risk, the player playing that character will get the Aspect die and the Arbiters will get the Mood die. 

- If the World is at risk, the player will get the Mood die and the Arbiters get the Aspect die.


#### Player chooses Mood and increments Mood Level

The player rolling the action reflects on what mood their character is in at this time. If this is represented by one of the moods currently on your character sheet, choose that one. If not and there are still unfilled moods, add a new one to your sheet and choose that one. The die associated with this Mood is referred to as your Mood Die.

Next, mark one of the checkboxes next to the selected Mood on your sheet. These boxes represent your Mood Level for that given Mood. Always increment the Mood Level, even if one of your other moods is overloaded. If this is the final box to be checked, this action will endanger one of your sentiments and change the mood as discussed in the Check for Mood Effects step.

You should be honest about how your character is feeling here! It can be tempting to select a mood based on which die you want to roll, but only do that if you can justify that particular mood by roleplaying as though your character is feeling that way.


#### Check details for Aspect Advantage or Disadvantage

Check the details of your character and the scene. Anything that is working in your favor will provide Aspect Advantage, and anything that is working against you will provide Aspect Disadvantage. Instances of advantage and disadvantage will cancel each other out, but do not stack. 

For both, you will roll your Aspect Die twice. With Advantage, you will choose the die. With disadvantage, the Arbiters choose.


#### Choose or create Relevant Skill (optional)

Choose one of the skills that you have listed on your character sheet that you can come up with a justification for why it applies here. Be creative! If you can convince the rest of the table that it makes sense to use a skill, you can use that skill. If there are still empty spaces on the sheet for skills, feel free to add a new one that would apply. New skills start with a modifier of 0, so it won't benefit you yet. 

Mark off the checkbox for Mind, Body, or Heart next to the chosen skill if it's unchecked. Checking all three boxes will allow you to upgrade the modifier of your skills, so get creative and use them often.



#### Risk Sentiment for Mood Advantage (optional)

You can gain Mood Advantage by anteing one of your sentiments that are not yet lost. Mood advantage allows you to roll your Mood Die twice and choose which result to keep. Work with the Arbiters to factor in how your mood and sentiment led to the details that get added to the scene.

If the Arbiters or an ally get to add negative details to the scene, you will also mark the next checkbox of that sentiment. This moves it to At Risk if it wasn’t already, or Lost if it it was already At Risk.


#### Roll your Aspect and Mood dice

Roll the dice given by your Mood and your Aspect and find the difference between the results.  Remember any Aspect or Mood Advantage or Disadvantage you received in the prior steps. If a mood is overloaded, you get advantage with that mood and disadvantage with all others.

If you have Advantage or Disadvantage for your Mood or Aspect, roll two of that die. Advantage allows the player to choose which die to keep, whereas disadvantage allows the Arbiters to choose. 


#### Get help. They roll a Mood and raise its level (optional).

If another character is helping in the fiction, they can describe how they help and roll their Mood die. They raise their Mood level as well and you can use either die. This character checks for Mood Effects as described in the next step as well.

If you choose to take their die, describe how this moment strengthens your relationship. If you reject their die and use your own instead, describe how they got in the way and how it negatively affects the relationship.



#### Determine the Winning Side and apply Details

Once you and the Arbiters have resolved all advantages and disadvantages and chosen the final two dice that are involved, decide whether your chosen Skill Value is added or subtracted from the Aspect die.

Find the difference between the two dice rolled and determine the Winning Side:

If the World was determined to be more at risk, the player wins if the Mood Die is higher than the Aspect Die.

If the Character was determined to be more at risk, the player wins if the Aspect Die is higher than the Mood Die.

The intersection of this table gives you that information as well:



#### Results Table

Use the row in the below table corresponding to the difference of the dice to add details:

0.	Each side adds one hard detail.

1.	Winning side adds one hard detail, but incurs one hard negative detail added by an ally.

2.	Winning side adds one hard detail.

3.	Winning side adds one hard detail and one scene detail.

4.	Winning side adds one hard detail and so does one ally.

5+	Winning side adds two hard details. 



#### Check for Mood Effects

If the Mood Die’s result is less than your current Mood Level, and the Mood Level is past the Overload Threshold on the character sheet, you Overload that Mood. Describe what this looks like and follow the rules on the next page for an Overloaded Mood for future rolls. This also applies to a character that helped you.

If you marked the final box of this Mood Level, this mood will evolve somewhat to represent how often you find yourself acting this way. Reset the mood level to 0.

The Winning Side will change the name of the mood to something more specific and intense. Examples could include changing Angry to Enraged, Determined to Obsessed, Happy to Gleeful, Cautious to Cowardly, or Brave to Feckless. If you are an Arbiter making the change, ensure that the player whose character is changing is comfortable with and interested in the change you have proposed.





#### Rules for an Overloaded Mood

A Mood gets overloaded when the Mood Level is above the Overload Threshold and the Mood Die rolls under the Mood Level. You and the Arbiters should take this into account when applying Details for that roll, and you should incorporate the over-use of that Mood in your roleplay while you remain overloaded.

Rolling while Overloaded

Be sure to increment whatever Mood you roll, even when Overloaded.

Rolls made with the Mood that you are overloaded with are made at Mood Advantage. 

Rolls made with other Moods are made at Mood Disadvantage. This could cause you to Overload a different mood. The following rules also apply when choosing a different Mood:

* Choosing a different Mood to act with will end the Overload regardless of who wins the roll. This should be represented and roleplayed in the fiction.

* If you win this roll, clear the checkboxes from the Mood that is no longer overloaded. Describe what it was like for your character to overcome in this way.

* If you lose this roll, put one of your sentiments at risk by marking the next unchecked checkbox. Describe which sentiment you are affecting and how it happens.

* If the roll has a difference of 0, follow the rules for both winning and losing the roll.

### Skills
#### What are skills?
Skills are anything that your character is good at. Each character starts with 3 skills that will immediately be helpful if they attempt to act in a way that uses those skills.These starting skills are also helpful for getting an idea of who this character is. Why are they good at origami, juggling, and flirting?

#### Using and creating skills
Each character starts with three skills that provide a + or - 1 to relevant rolls, and can add more through play.

To use a skill, you declare which one you are using before your roll. If you have no relevant skill, but do have some empty skill slots, you can create a new skill that you are trying to use which will start at +/- 0. Fill the name of that skill in on one of the empty lines and place a 0 in the modifier circle.

After rolling the dice, you decide whether to add or subtract the value of the skill from the Aspect Die.

#### Advancing skills
The 3 boxes to the right of each skill line allow you to keep track of which aspects have been used to make checks with that skill. Once you have completed an action roll with a skill, mark the box corresponding to the aspect used next to the skill on your sheet.
When you've marked all 3 boxes, and thus completed a task with that skill using each of the three aspects, you are eligible to upgrade that skill as a free action during your next downtime as described in the Downtime Actions section.


### Sentiments

During character creation, each player writes down 3 things that are important to their character. Each sentiment should evoke strong feelings when the character thinks about it, and it's encouraged to show this through your roleplaying. A character’s sentiments are their prized possessions, relationships, ideals, beliefs, or anything else that your character holds dear. Seeing the three things that a character cares about is another lens into who they are and can help you jump right into roleplaying them.

#### Sentiment States
Sentiments can be in one of 3 states - connected, at risk, and lost. If neither checkbox on the character sheet is marked, the character is considered connected to that sentiment. The At Risk checkbox indicates if the sentiment is at risk, and the lost checkbox indicates that the sentiment is lost.A lost sentiment cannot be used mechanically at all.

#### Risking sentiments to gain Mood Advantage

Before rolling the dice, you can put your sentiment at risk to gain Mood Advantage on the roll. Mood advantage allows you to roll the dice given by your emotion twice and take either result. Depending on the effect level you achieve, the sentiment can be endangered. Before declaring this, you have to describe how the sentiment is coming into play for the roll. If the Arbiters or an ally get to add negative details to the scene, you will also mark the next checkbox of that sentiment.This moves it to At Risk if it wasn’t already, or Lost if it it was already At Risk. 

### How to use the Collateral Clock

When designing a location, the author makes note of what can be harmed by the explorers' actions at that location. In general, when players stay at a location for too long, there will be more and more collateral damage. This is represented by an eight step "clock" at each location. Any player at any time can tick this clock if they feel that an action a character has taken leads the group closer to fully actualizing that harm.

#### Why have Collateral Clocks?

This game is partially about the adverse affects that are often left unspoken in stories about reclaiming a broken world. Often, to "reclaim" something you need to take it from someone or something else, displacing them in the process.When acting as Arbiter, it's your job to consider the problems that are being caused as your story plays out. Fill out your descriptions and reactions of the world the characters live in with this in mind.

#### Collateral Clocks and Scene Details

Choosing whether the world or character is at risk on each action roll is done to help guide you to consider what kind of situations can arise when players act in dramatic ways. Factor in the listed danger and collateral from the location card and choose details that would drive home this conflict between the adventurer and the land they are interfering with.Tick the Collateral Clock when you are adding Details granted by action rolls in which the World was determined at risk.The Arbiters’ job is to introduce complications that lead to a more interesting story - make your Hard Details and Scene Details hit hard and show true consequences.


### Downtime

#### What is downtime?
Downtime is the time between adventures that the explorers spend researching the new technologies they've acquired, healing their wounds, reconnecting with their sentiments, addressing the damage they have caused, and reflecting on their emotional states. Downtime is not camping out overnight in the middle of an adventure. It represents a time span greater than that, from weeks to months, where adventure isn't actively being sought out. How long one “unit” of time during downtime takes should have been established when defining scope, but agree on that now if you haven’t already.

#### Rolling for complications
The legacy of the explorers' interference doesn't stop progressing just because they have left the area.At the start of each downtime phase, you will roll for complications for the Location you just left to see the immediate effects of your actions.You will roll for additional locations as described in the Downtime at Home section.

The number of ticks on the Collateral Clock of the location in focus determines which of the following tables is used to see how the Collateral is progressing there. Take the result and collectively describe what it means and looks like in that location. Describe any rippling effects that this progression might have in the surrounding area. Don’t hold back on these descriptions. Be honest with how the actions your adventurers take affect the world they are exploring, even if it causes problems with your character’s goals and ambitions. Increase the Collateral Clock if it makes sense to during your description.

The result prompts are intentionally vague so that your table has more to work with. Every game is different, so the prompts here should apply to just about any situation you’ve found yourselves in.


### Selecting a table

Look at the Collateral Clock for the location that you are rolling complications for and select the table below that corresponds to current number of ticks. Roll a d6 to get the result.

*Locations with 1-3 Collateral*
1 Area in recovery
2-3 Problem Intensifies/An Unforeseen Side Effect
4-5 RelationsWorsen
6 Problem Spreads Elsewhere

*Locations with 4-5 Collateral*
1-3 Problem Intensifies or RelationsWorsen
4-5 Problem Spreads Elsewhere
6 Those Affected Flee

*Locations with 6-7 Collateral*
1-3 RelationsWorsen/Problem Spreads Elsewhere
4-5 Those Affected Flee
6 Problem Intensifies

#### What is the effect at home?
Once you have rolled and described the complication for a location, take some time to describe any changes to your home that may have occurred since we have last seen it Consider the rippling effect of any collateral as well as the treasures you have returned to as a reference.

#### Taking Downtime Actions
Once you have rolled and described the complication for the Location you last adventured in, it’s time to take Downtime Actions.The actions are described starting on the next page, and are mechanical representations of the things that the characters are doing between adventures.

Each character gets one Downtime Action. Once per Downtime Phase, each character can also do both of the Downtime Free Actions. 

#### Downtime at Home

If your downtime is taking place in your home settlement, or otherwise somewhere that you are able to sleep comfortably with both eyes closed, the characters can rest easy.You each take 1 recovery point, which is tracked next to the Harm Details on the character sheet. Collectively decide how much time passes. For each unit of time that you decide passes, each character gets an additional Downtime action. However, you will also roll for additional complications for each unit of time. Choose a revealed location and use the table on page 36 for each one.

#### Downtime actions “on screen”
Each action should make sense in the fiction, but you don't need to zoom in or stage scenes for every action that people take. Often, a simple description of what's happening will suffice. However, sometimes some really interesting things can happen in downtime and this should be encouraged. If you think somebody’s downtime activities might be a fun scene to play out, play it out. 

#### What actions can you take?
Below are the Downtime Actions that you can take.There are also two Downtime Free Actions that each player gets to use once per Downtime phase.The following pages have detailed descriptions of what to do when you select each action.

Downtime Free Actions
• Recover Harm
• Upgrade Skills

Downtime Actions
• Long-Term Project
• Reconnect with sentiments
• Introspection
• Address collateral
• Train Skills
• Seek recovery
• Scout

#### Long-Term Project
When you work on a long-term project (either a brand new one, or an already existing one), describe what your character does to advance the project clock, and roll a relevant Mood and Aspect (including skills). Mark a number of segments equal to the difference of the two dice.

A long-term project can cover a wide variety of activities, like doing research into an arcane ritual, investigating a mystery, establishing someone’s trust, courting a new friend or contact, or forging and reconnecting sentiments in a more controlled way. Based on the goal of the project, collectively decide how many steps the clock(s) you will create have and suggest a method by which you might make progress. Usually, this will be 4, 6, or 8 steps.

In order to work on a project, you must have to achieve the means to pursue it—which can be a project in itself. For example, you might want to build a new meeting house, but have no access to carpentry skills.You must first acquire these skills, so you start a learn carpentry project first, describing how you come to learn these skills. Once that project completes, you could start a new project to actually build the meeting house.

#### Reconnect with Sentiments
You can spend downtime reconnecting with your lost or at risk sentiments.Alternatively, if one is lost and doesn't make sense to be reconnected with, you can forge a new one. This action allows you to reconnect or forge only one sentiment; additional actions would need to be taken if multiple sentiments are lost or At Risk. 

Reconnecting or forging new sentiments is an emotional event, so you increase a relevant Mood Level by the following amount:
Reconnect to a lost sentiment by raising the Mood Level by three, moving the sentiment to At Risk.
Clear the At Risk checkbox by raising the Mood Level by two.                     
Forge a new sentiment by raising the Mood Level by four.

#### Introspection
Emotions run high while explorers go adventuring, and they often need some much needed rest to reflect on what they were feeling while out and why they were feeling it. Choosing the Introspection action means that the character is reflecting on their experience and the moods that their actions put them in. Roll your Heart die, and reduce that number of ticks from your various Mood Levels. Describe what your character is reflecting on and how they do this.

Additionally, while in introspection, you can swap any two Moods. Swapping means you swap the die that is associated with one of your Moods with another.Transfer the Mood Levels as well. You can also replace one mood that has a Mood Level of 0 entirely if you feel that your character no longer sits in that mood often.

#### Address Collateral
While adventuring, you track the damage done to the environment you are exploring with the Collateral Clock. Addressing collateral requires both a method with which to reverse the harm done and the resources to apply that method.

Choose a location that your group has affected, and describe your plan to undo the damage.The other players discuss whether or not you have the resources to enact your plan. For each player that believes that your plan is good and you have the resources to enact it, take +1 to the roll. For each player that dissents, take -1 to the roll.

If you do not like your odds after these modifiers, you can instead pivot this action to starting a Long-Term Project to address the concerns about your plan raised by the other players.

If you are going through with the plan, roll your Mind die. Reduce the Collateral Clock of the chosen location by a number of ticks equal (die roll + modifers) - (Collateral Level). if you don't quite make it to your target, you or someone else can spend an additional downtime action to add another die to the mix. This can be either Mind, Heart, or Body, depending on what you think was causing the plan to be ineffective. Each die you roll adds to your current total. A negative final result will increase the Collateral Level. Your attempts to address the situation at hand do more harm than good.

#### Train Skills
Roll your Mind, Body, or Heart die and check off the box for the resultant number of skills corresponding to that die. For example, if you roll your Body die and get a 3, you can check off the Body box for 3 skills.

#### Seek recovery
Explorers can get pretty beat up while adventuring, and choosing this action means that the character is spending time to heal their wounds. Roll your Body die, and take that many Recovery Points.
If you have access to a healer or healing facilities at your settlement, you can roll your Body die twice. You can also add any relevant skills. If a teammate is helping you with this, that player can also roll their Heart die and apply their skills to add to your total.

#### Scout
Most of the locations on the map are face down.The people of the settlement might know vaguely of the contents of these cards, but nobody is quite sure where in the world these rumors originate from. Scouting can help see what is on nearby cards. Describe how you are scouting and choose a facedown card that is close enough that it makes sense for you to scout during this downtime. Typically this means it's neighboring where you currently are or you can get there through known and non-hostile locations.

Follow the Action Roll steps to see if you are successful. All players that don't choose to assist act as Arbiters for the sake of adding Details given by the Action Roll. If you lose the roll, you can choose to either reject the details and return home, or accept the Details to press forward. If you accept the Details or win the roll, privately look at the card.Take mental note of it, and return it to the board face down. Share the information if you like, perhaps one of the other adventurers has heard rumors about the place and can provide more detail.

#### Recover Harm
You spend a number of Recovery Points equal to the number of Harm Details you have to convert one harm detail into a scar. You can do this as many times as you can afford. Scars are Details that are shadows of former harm. For example, you could convert embarrassed into bashful, broken wrist into stiff wrist, or cast out into mistrusted.

#### Upgrade Skills
Characters may upgrade the skills that have all 3 checkboxes filled. Increment the modifier by one.


## Part 4: Play Advice & Reference

### Agenda

As you play this game, aim to satisfy the Agenda every time you’re contributing to the fiction.
• Portray a living, recovering world
• Show the characters the effects of their actions
• Play to find out what happens

#### Portray a living, recovering world
When you are describing the world either as Arbiter or when designing a location during theWorldbuilding phase, think about who or what lives there and how that changes the land. Show evidence of who else lives there, whether other people or animals. Describe plant life. Build ecosystems.
Along with that, describe what used to be here. Include archaic constructions, and if they are dilapidated or if they’ve been repurposed. Give characters ancient technology, and baffle them with their functions.

#### Show the characters the effects of their actions
When a player interacts with the world, think about the effects. Were they rude to an NPC? People talk. Did they try to blast open a door?That explosion might be the last thing it took for this old building to start falling. Or worse, the noise and vibrations may awaken something better left alone.

#### Play to find out what happens
Don’t go into a session or even a scene knowing what’s going to happen.Allow yourself to be surprised at the results of all of the Details added by various players. It’s fun to discover a story together.

### Principles
The principles serve as your guide when you are playing the game and adding Details. Following the principles is a good way to satisfy the Agenda and make sure everybody is having a good time playing this game.
• Be a fan of the characters
• Be a fan of the world
• Check in with the other players
• Reveal this place’s secrets
• Change the landscape
• These locations are home, but not your home
• Think new, think ancient
• Be honest and add Details that follow the fiction
• Pass to the other Arbiters
• Endanger your character
• Name every person
• Give every creature life
• Skip the boring parts

#### Be a fan of the characters
The player characters are the protagonists of this story. Play them as such!Take bold actions and expect them to do well. If you’re adding Details to another player’s character, add something that will be interesting for their narrative.

#### Be a fan of the world
The story takes place in a world that you collectively created. Explore it, describe it, and allow it to shine in your story.

#### Check in with the other players
Playing a game like this takes a lot of time as well as emotional effort and creative output. From time to time, check in with each other and make sure that you’re all still enjoying the game. If you’re not, work with your group to figure out what can be done to make your time more enjoyable.

#### Reveal this place’s secrets
The world that you play in was built up and destroyed many times. In real life, the contents of your second desk drawer can be surprising.Who could say what secrets litter the landscapes and buildings you’re exploring? Open that drawer and let out whatever’s inside.

#### Change the landscape
Think big! Make sweeping changes to the land, and then play to find out what happens as a result.A button is pressed and a rumbling is heard for a minute until a huge tower erupts out of the ground.The adventurers weren’t careful when they were messing around on that dam, and it’s about to flood.

#### These locations are home, but not your home
Things live in the places that your characters are exploring. Sometimes there are people you can talk to, sometimes there are people that communicate in a totally different way. Sometimes there aren’t any people, but the place is full of different animals. Sometimes all you can find is a trace of life, perhaps hiding just out of sight.

#### Think new, think ancient
Imagine futuristic technologies and buildings, and then imagine them ruined and repurposed. Imagine things that were too strange or hidden to be repurposed until now.

#### Be honest and add Details that follow the fiction
When choosing which parts of your character to use, be honest with yourself and your table and only use what actually makes sense.When adding Details as Arbiter because a player lost a roll, don’t hold back. Complicated the scene in a way that follows the fiction, even if it leads to the character having a harder time.

#### Pass to the other Arbiters
Unless you’re playing with just 2 or 3 people, there will almost always be at least one other Arbiter sharing duties with you. Share those duties! Describe some of the scene, and then gesture towards the others to take over and finish the description. You’ll be surprised how different their ideas are and how interesting the combination can be.

#### Endanger your character
While we are a fan of the characters, we also want an interesting story. Put them in dangerous situations and see what happens next. Push that button, enter that dark hallway, stand your ground against the large rats threatening you.
When you’re acting as Arbiter, add Details to the current scene that complicate the situation your own character is in. It will give the other players something to go off of when your character comes back on screen.

#### Name every person
Characters in the world can be way more interesting when you’re thinking of names for them.Any time there is a non-player character on screen when you are Arbiter, give them a name and think about what their daily life is like.

#### Give every creature life
The world is full of all sorts of creatures, each one living a rich and complex life as they try to survive long enough to make it worth it. Give them motivations and show how they live.

#### Skip the boring parts
When traveling between locations in this game, we don’t roleplay what is happening moment-to-moment on your travels. We skip that part, because it’s not likely to be as interesting as the proper adventure at the location that somebody designed.

Use this on the adventures themselves as well. This doesn’t have to be a realistic simulation. Skip past parts that won’t be as fun. For example, if you think it’s time to leave a location and everyone is relatively safe, just collectively decide how you meet up. Unless it’s going to be interesting, you don’t need to show that on screen or roll dice to do it.
